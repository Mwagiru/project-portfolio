                <p>Hello, I am <b>JOY MWAGIRU</b>. It is nice to meet you!</p><br><br><br>
                <p class="one">I am a software developer currently in Nairobi,Kenya.You could say I like a little bit of everything and bring simplicity and classiness to this field. I am a computer science student at Africa Nazarene University. I however, decided to take a break inorder to sharpen my coding skills. I am currently taking a Software Development course at MORINGA SCHOOL. I love creating and I am loving this journey so far. I love challenges and believe we learn more from failure stories. I love exploring new things, places. I am also slowly cultivating a reading habit.You can call me MWAGIRU. </p><br><br>Everyone has a quote or something that gives them strength to continue in their journey and I want to share mine with you.

                <p> Every programmer needs a portfolio to basically showcase their work. The portfolio helps gauge the programmer's
                skills.Now before diving into the portfolio, one will obviously view the homepage and this project focuses on creating a
                good homepage for the portfolio..This was a sample PORTFOLIO webpage. It was the first project I did when i joined Moringa(and quite frankly,EVER!).It was also the first webpage I ever successfully deployed to gh-pages.The project was built solely using HTML and CSS.<a href="https://mwagiru.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">Click here</a>to view the page.</p>

                <p> This project was built to help you figure that out.Not only does it help you figure out the day of the week you were born, but also introduces you to a special Ghanian tradition.There is a community in Ghana called Akan, that names babies based on their gender and the day of the week they were born.This project requires you to input Date Of Birth and upon submission, your Akan name is displayed. Try it<a href="https://mwagiru.github.io/Akan-name-DOB/" target="_blank"> NOW.</a></p>
